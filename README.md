# Functions-Classes-in-Python
Description: Solve the following 

 

Task 1:  Define a function in Python that accepts two strings as inputs from the user. The defined function should basically check whether the second string could be built-up from the first string.  

For e.g: str1 = “Elephant”,  str2=”pale” 

Here the second string could actually be built from the first one as it has all the letters. 

 

Task 2:  Write a Program that takes any number of arguments and calculates their powers. If only one argument is given, it should return its square; if two arguments are given, return the result of raising the first to the power of the second. If more than two arguments are given it should sum up all the numbers other than the last one and should be raised with the last number. 

 

Task 3:  Create a  Python class that can act as an Employee Registration system. The class should have methods to initialize the properties of the employees and also to display them.
